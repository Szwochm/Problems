# The Problem: Portable Progamming Enviroment

1. I am taking classes that need the following IDEs

    Intellij, Android Studio, Eclipse, and Visual Code.

2. I am trying to use minimal resources as I work on school computers, personal computers, and my laptop. I want to put the enviroment on a harddrive that I can just plug n play on any device

## Proposed Solution \#1 Docker Containers

## Questions to answer:

### Do docker containers use less resources than hosting a vm?

Yes, according to [1](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/vm-vs-containers/), the following is a comparison of docker vs VMs

### Can I run the same containers on both Windows and Linux?

### Is there any problems associated with running Programming Enviroments on containers?

### Is there docker container support for the IDEs specified?
